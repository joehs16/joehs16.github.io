# About Me.
Labels always seem to fall short. I would describe myself as a data scientist, an engineer, a team player,
Data Science is a fascinating field. It is the current beachhead of where companies are fighting to get \[PLACEHOLDER]

\[REWRITE]
Have you ever heard of [CliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx)? When I started my Masters program at Duke University, the program directors focused on finding candidates borrowed the idea from the Fuqua MBA program and had us all take the 1+ hour assessment to help in their yearlong team assignments. What stood out was the contrast of my strengths to those of my peers; while they all had the traits that you would normally expect for a quantitative-centric program (e.g. "analytical", "strategic". "intellection"), Although my strengths were not surprising to myself (in order: "Responsibility", "Arranger", "Individualization", "Empathy", "Belief"); what was more striking was the contrast between my cohort and myself- my core strengths revolve around 

# Education
I received my masters degree in Data Science from Duke University (Durham, NC) and my undergraduate degree from Drexel University (Philadelphia, PA), majoring in Materials Science and Engineering with double minors in Nuclear Engineering and Business Administration.

## Duke University
* MS in Data Science

Duke's [Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) program](https://datascience.duke.edu/) is a highly-competitive, full-time 2-year program designed to develop technical experts while leveraging Duke's premier faculty and facilities to provide experts in different fields to address growing need of the ability to unlock and harness the vast amount data that is gathered in the modern world.

During recruiting, the MIDS program directors were focused on finding data science "unicorns"- students who have the ability to code, have the statistical skills, have strong domain knowledge, all encapsulated with the ability to communicate their findings and have the soft skills needed to be effective at their jobs.

Because data science has wide application and has become essential in virtually every industry, the two-year format allows the program to equip each student with the skills needed to be an effective "generalist" data scientist within the first year of the program and then goes on to allow each student to become data science "specialists"; opening up Duke's wealth of high-level graduate school and allowing each MIDS student to take any elective that would strengthen their domain knowledge and/or dive deeper into subjects that normal programs do not have access to.

## Drexel University
* BS in Materials Science and Engineering
* Minors in Nuclear Engineering and Business Administration

At Drexel I studied in the renowned [Materials Science and Engineering Department](https://drexel.edu/engineering/academics/departments/materials-science-engineering/), developing a passion for asking the deeper questions and practicing the scientific method through research. Research opportunities were highly accessible due to th3e wonderful student to professor ratio, and I had the privilege.

# Work Experience
My major experience has been in the public sector, operating within the defense, federal contracting, industrial manufacturing, and engineering spaces.

## Booz Allen Hamilton (2021-)
Following my graduation from Duke University, I joined Booz Allen Hamilton in McLean, VA as a data scientist working in the healthcare sector.

## US Bank (2020-2020)
US Bank is the 5th largest bank in the United States. Between years 1 and 2 of my Master's degree, I interned at US Bank as a data scientist, working with Chief Data Officer Vijay Akella to explore weak supervision solutions to help improve the Data Governance team. The majority of my time was invested in exploring and prototyping [Holoclean](http://www.holoclean.io). The whitepaper that I produced can be found [here](placeholder), and additional information can be found in this [post](placeholder).

## Naval Foundry and Propeller Center, NAVSEA (2017-2019)
The Naval Foundry and Propeller Center (NFPC) is a 300+ personnel facility whose primary mission is to operate as the U.S. Navy's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for nuclear submarine propulsors (i.e. the propeller and related static mechanical assembly). NFPC is a mission-critical asset to the U.S. Navy's ability to produce and maintain their naval nuclear interests. Due to the relatively small size of the facility during my time there, NPFC had been given an Herculean task - be the longest tent pole in the first production of the new Columbia-class nuclear submarine, a [\$14B+ project](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=R41129), which provided a lot of both opportunity and scrutiny. At a high-level, I was appointed by the deputy director to a new role which (WARNING: incoming government lingo):
- interfaced with internal shareholders to identify where mission-critical failures might occur, 
- perform market research to transform the identified failures into feasible solutions, 
- develop federal solicitation packages  (i.e. Government contracts), translating the desired solutions into contracting language and actionable contract line items, 
- develop sole-source justification when needed, 
- interface with an external contract officer's team to ensure that the contracts would get on the street smoothly, 
- provide technical evaluation of the solicitation responses for the contracting office
- operate as the Contract Officer's Representative for executed contracts to ensure that deliverables were being fulfilled.

 During my time at NFPC, I was able to (continuing the Hercules analogy) slay the Nemean Lion (establish a repeatable contracting process and secure a $7.5M sole-source contract for a critical propulsor part), track down the Lernean Hydra (begin the year-long contracting process with the Contracting Officer on several high-priority contracts, reducing the time to get the contracts onto the street), and provide the groundwork for the following labors to be accomplishable (establish and revamp additional processes that corrected and ensured on-time delivery from other federal manufacturers). 

Due to NFPC's size and start-up like nature, it was necessary for me to assume all these responsibilities to ensure that my projects were successful, and I am grateful and proud to have had the opportunity to undertake such an important role!

## Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (2015-2017)
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is a 12,000+ personnel facility and is one of four public shipyards where the U.S. Navy owns and performs repairs and overhauls to nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers. I started my career here as a nuclear engineer working the Radiation Control Office, which provides internal governance over nuclear work to protect the employees, the public, and the environment. I would describe this job as a mix of an engineer, a lawyer, and a referee. My time here was highlighted by the opportunity to work together and build relations with co-workers from different backgrounds. My role had me interfacing with senior foremen, machinists, truck drivers, machine operators, engineers, engineering managers, department heads, etc. Because of the nature of my oversight role, I had to interface and interact with every level and aspect of the organization. As a junior engineer I had an accelerated role that was able to provide tangible contribution and impact to the mission.
