Description This function was build in support of the BIGIDEAS Lab&amp;rsquo;s Covidentify Project (Duke University). The intention of the function is to extract, transform, and load the unstructured json data from the database that houses the Fitbit and Garmin API pulls into Microsoft Azure&amp;rsquo;s ML Studio.
Background Because of the nature of Duke&amp;rsquo;s Internal Review Board (IRB), the lab does not have direct control over the API pulls and thus using noSQL was not an option at this time.</description></item></channel></rss>
